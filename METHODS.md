# Methods and Technical Architecture

## Overview

The Kansas State Biorepository Host-Parasite Atlas uses a host-centered relational model to visualize museum-vouchered host–parasite associations. The web application is static and browser-based; preprocessing is performed before deployment so the client does not need to query the source collection database for every interaction.

## Source records

The development workflow begins with an Arctos export of parasite specimen records containing specimen GUIDs, taxonomic fields, collection dates, coordinates, related-cataloged-item relationships, and selected specimen attributes. The processing script identifies relationships explicitly labeled `parasite of` and uses the related GUID as the host identifier.

For a publication release, document here what my exact Arctos query, export date, collections included, record count, fields requested, and any other exclusion criteria I use.

## Host–parasite relationships

A host-parasite association is retained when a parasite record contains an Arctos related-cataloged-item relationship identified as `parasite of`. Host and parasite GUIDs are preserved as persistent record identifiers in the derived atlas dataset.

## Taxonomy

Parasite taxonomy is retained at kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species where available. The browser interface implements cascading taxonomic filters: selection of a higher rank restricts available lower-rank values to combinations represented in the loaded dataset.

Host taxon labels in the development dataset are obtained from the `verbatim host ID` attribute associated with parasite records. For a production release, authoritative host identifications should be preferred where available and the taxonomic source should be documented explicitly.

## Temporal data

The processing script extracts an explicit four-digit year from the verbatim date field. Records without an explicit four-digit year are assigned an unknown-year state rather than having a century inferred. The interface allows users to include or exclude records with unknown years.

## Spatial data

In the development dataset, host coordinates are inferred from coordinates associated with linked parasite records. When multiple linked parasite coordinates are available for a host, the processing script currently derives a representative host coordinate from those linked values.

For a publication release, authoritative host-record coordinates are preferred. Coordinate uncertainty, georeferencing method, datum, locality restrictions, and sensitive-data handling should be documented if they are relevant to the released dataset.

## Compact representation

To reduce browser transfer size, repeated strings are stored in a shared string dictionary. Parasite, host, and relationship tables then reference those strings by integer identifier. The resulting `atlas.json` contains:

- `s`: shared strings;
- `m`: parasite metadata;
- `h`: host metadata; and
- `r`: host–parasite relationships.

The JavaScript decoder functions in `index.html` must remain synchronized with the positional field order written by `process_compact_atlas.py`.

## Map behavior

Each mapped marker represents one host record with mappable coordinates. Marker clustering is used to improve rendering and readability at broad map scales. Parasite filters act on the set of linked parasite records; a host is displayed when at least one linked parasite satisfies the active parasite and temporal filters in addition to the host-level filters.

## Filtered export

The browser can generate a CSV from the active filters without requiring a server-side process. Each output row represents one host–parasite association and includes host identifiers, host taxon and collection, coordinates, parasite identifiers and taxonomy, collection year, and selected parasite attributes.

## Quality-control recommendations for a publication release

Before freezing a release, verify: duplicate GUID handling; relationship parsing; missing and malformed dates; coordinate validity; taxonomic rank consistency; host identification provenance; counts of source records, unique hosts, parasites, and associations; agreement between filtered map results and CSV exports; and a random sample of atlas records against their authoritative source records.
